  1. Make sure there is only ONE excel sheet/tab in once excel file.
  2. Make sure there are only letters/alphabets in TAMs and columns fields.
  3. For file path, use forward slashes '/' instead of backward slashes '\'.
     ie. C:/Users/t-ninikf/Downloads/file.exe
  4. Make sure column names are correct.
  5. Output file name must be valid characters. NO / \ : * ? " | < > symbols.
  6. All files to be read (excel sheet from Unicorn, tracker excel sheet) and output file MUST be closed before running the program.



## Info: ##
